## 1. Mobile app (React Native)
The basis of the project is a mobile application written in React Native, whose basic functionalities are taking, deleting, editing and sharing photos. In addition, we can use it to browse the gallery of our phone. We can also save photos on the server and directly display them on the phone by opening the web application with the help of the application.

## 2. Server app (Express. js)
The application is responsible for saving uploaded photos to the server and their handling after receiving requests from the web application.

## 3. Web app (React, Tailwind)
It allows you to view photos stored on the server, delete them and edit their names.
